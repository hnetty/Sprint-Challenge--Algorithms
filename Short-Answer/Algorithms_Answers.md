#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime => O(n). This is because there will be a strictly linear increase of operations as the input increases.


b) Runtime => O(n log n). This is because the loop variable 'i' deals with O(n) time, and the 'j'  doubles with every pass/run through the loops. 


c) Runtime => O(n). Much like the first one, this recursion will increase linearly with n, the input.
